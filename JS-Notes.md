# JS-Notes 𝒥𝓈

Since I'm new to Java script language, this note has been created to summarize Java script syntax used during twitter clone project.

### Const
- A const variable cannot be reassigned:
Example:
```javascript
const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error
```
